# Hwaet's Up Doc - Take Two

## Description
Welcome to the Hwaet's Up Doc, a website where I can showcase my work. This repository serves to create a website on which my information, contact and otherwise, as well as my current and upcoming projects can be showcased in an accessible and visually pleasing manner. It also serves as an insight into my aesthetic sensibilities and features I find interesting. Though this application serves as a professional portfolio, I refuse not to have fun while doing it.
## Usage
To access the application/webpage, navigate to https://benhwaet.github.io/HwaetsUpDoc/. The navigation links are functional and so are the videogame platform profiles, while the email is non-functional for the moment.
To see the base files and the fist attemps at accomplishing this project, see the repository on https://github.com/Benhwaet/HwaetsUpDoc.

The intent is to keep working on this website as I learn more about web development, in order to iplement these new concepts. See commits and file comments for details.
