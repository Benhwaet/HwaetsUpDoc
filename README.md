# HwaetsUpDoc

## Take Two
## Description
Welcome to the Hwaet's Up Doc, a website where I can showcase my work. This repository serves to create a website on which my information, contact and otherwise, as well as my current and upcoming projects can be showcased in an accessible and visually pleasing manner. It also serves as an insight into my aesthetic sensibilities and features I find interesting. Though this application serves as a professional portfolio, I refuse not to have fun while doing it.
## Usage
<<<<<<< Updated upstream

=======
To access the application/webpage, navigate to https://benhwaet.github.io/HwaetsUpDoc/. The navigation links are functional and so are the videogame platform profiles, while the email is non-functional at the moment.
To see the base files and the first attempts at accomplishing this project, see the repository on https://github.com/Benhwaet/HwaetsUpDoc.
The placeholder images are to represent future projects that will serve as examples of my work.

The intent is to keep working on this website as I learn more about web development, in order to implement these new concepts. See commits and file comments for details.
